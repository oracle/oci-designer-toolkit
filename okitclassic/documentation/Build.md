# OCI Designer Toolkit Installation Guide
## Build from Source

### OKIT Repository
Before the building either the Docker or Vagrant Images the project will need to be cloned, or downloaded, from the GitHub 
Repository.  

#### Clone
The command shows how this can be cloned to the local machine.

```bash
git clone -c core.autocrlf=input git@github.com:oracle/oci-designer-toolkit.git
```

or 

```bash
git clone -c core.autocrlf=input https://github.com/oracle/oci-designer-toolkit.git
```

#### Update
If you have previously cloned the GitHub Repository you can update to the latest release by pulling it from the repository 
with the following command.

```bash
cd oci-designer-toolkit
git pull
```

#### Download
If you do not have git installed locally the current release of OKIT can be retrieved by downloading it as a zip file from
