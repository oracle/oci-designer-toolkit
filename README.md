_____

OCI designer and visualisation toolKIT (OKIT) is a browser based tool that allows the user to [design](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/introduction-to-okit-the-oci-designer-toolkit), 
[deploy](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/introduction-to-okit-the-oci-designer-toolkit) and visualise ([introspect/query](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/the-oci-designer-toolkit-query-feature)) 
OCI environments through a graphical web based interface. 

- [Design](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/introduction-to-okit-the-oci-designer-toolkit)

    The Web based interface will allow architects and designers to build a visual representation of their infrastructure
    and then export this in a number of formats. 

    - svg
    - png
    - jpeg

- [Export](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/introduction-to-okit-the-oci-designer-toolkit)

    Once completed the design can be enhanced to add key property information allowing the designed infrastructure to
    be exported to a number of DevOps frameworks or Markdown for documentation.
    
    - Terraform
    - OCI Resource Manager
    - Markdown
    
    This allows for rapid proto-typing and building.

- [Introspect](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/the-oci-designer-toolkit-query-feature)

    OKIT will also allow the user to introspect existing OCI environments, through simple query functionality embedded within the
    web interface, to provide a portable generic json file, that can be used to visualise existing systems or generate terraform/ansible.

### OCI Config File

Create the OCI cli __config__ file in the directory __&lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.oci__ with contents similar to that below.
The __*key_file*__ is a fixed value because the contents of the __&lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.oci__ will be mounted to the
appropriate users home directory, as __~/.oci__, during the run process.

```properties
[DEFAULT]
user=ocid1.user.oc1..aaaaaaaak6z......
fingerprint=3b:7e:37:ec:a0:86:1....
key_file=~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem  
tenancy=ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaawpqblfem........
region=us-phoenix-1
```

If connecting to a PCA or C3 machine that requires a cert bundle then an additional entry will need to be added to the config file entry specifying
the location of the cert bundle similar to the following.
```properties
cert-bundle=~/.oci/certs/certbundle.cert
```

### GIT Settings File

If Git integration is required you will need to create a __git_repositories__ file within the directory 
__&lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.oci__ with contents similar to that below.

```properties
[OKIT Community Templates]
branch=main
url=git@github.com:username/okit-community-templates.git
  
[Example Repo]
branch = master
url = git@url1.git

[Internal]
branch = BRANCHNAME
url = git@url2.git
```

This properties file contains a list of the Git repositories you want to access. It assumes that you are using public/private
key access, the key files exist within your __&lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.ssh__ directory and the __&lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.ssh/config__
defines the key/url mapping, similar to the following.

```properties
Host github.com
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github
```
