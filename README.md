# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Designer and Visualisation Toolkit [0.16.0](CHANGELOG.md#version-0.16.0)

OCI designer and visualisation toolKIT (OKIT) is a browser based tool that allows the user to [design](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/introduction-to-okit-the-oci-designer-toolkit), 
[deploy](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/introduction-to-okit-the-oci-designer-toolkit) and visualise ([introspect/query](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/the-oci-designer-toolkit-query-feature)) 
OCI environments through a graphical web based interface. 

- [Design](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/introduction-to-okit-the-oci-designer-toolkit)

    The Web based interface will allow architects and designers to build a visual representation of their infrastructure
    and then export this in a number of formats. 

    - svg
    - png
    - jpeg

- [Export](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/introduction-to-okit-the-oci-designer-toolkit)

    Once completed the design can be enhanced to add key property information allowing the designed infrastructure to
    be exported to a number of DevOps frameworks or Markdown for documentation.
    
    - Ansible
    - Terraform
    - OCI Resource Manager
    - Markdown
    
    This allows for rapid proto-typing and building.

- [Introspect](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/the-oci-designer-toolkit-query-feature)

    OKIT will also allow the user to introspect existing OCI environments, through simple query functionality embedded within the
    web interface, to provide a portable generic json file, that can be used to visualise existing systems or generate terraform/ansible.

## Installation
Detailed OKIT Installation steps can be found in the [OCI Designer Toolkit Installation Guide](documentation/Installation.md).

_Note:_
```diff
- OKIT is designed to be installed as a local single user container and it is recommended that you 
- do NOT install OKIT on an OCI Instance. Installing on an OCI Instance will leave you OCI Tenancy 
- open to anyone who can find the IP address. If you do decide to install on an OCI Instance the 
- OCI Designer Toolkit Installation Guide will give some recommendations for securing your Instance.
```

### Runtime Quick Start
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is the recommended runtime container for OKIT. The project contains a top-level Dockerfile to facilitate direct
building, of the runtime environment, from the docker command line.

#### Prerequisites 
Before building / running OKIT you will need to install [Docker / Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

#### Build Docker Container
```bash
docker build --tag okit --force-rm https://github.com/oracle/oci-designer-toolkit.git
```

#### Create / Generate Connection Information
If you already have the OCI sdk/cli installed on you machine you can use the previously generated pem key and config file
we will assume that this exists in &lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.oci 

##### Key File

If you do not have a previously generated private key you will need to create a private/public key pair for use with OKIT and OCI.
These keys can be generated using the following commands as defined in [Required Keys and OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm).

```bash
openssl genrsa -out <USER HOME DIR>/.oci/oci_api_key.pem 2048   
openssl rsa -pubout -in <USER HOME DIR>/.oci/oci_api_key.pem -out <USER HOME DIR>/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem                                  
```

Upload the generated __oci_api_key_public.pem__ to OCI through the [console](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm) and record the associated fingerprint following upload.

###### Get Fingerprint
```bash
openssl rsa -pubout -outform DER -in ~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem | openssl md5 -c
```

##### OCI Config File

Create the OCI cli __config__ file in the directory __&lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.oci__ with contents similar to that below.
The __*key_file*__ is a fixed value because the contents of the __&lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.oci__ will be mounted to the
appropriate users home directory, as __~/.oci__, during the run process.

```properties
[DEFAULT]
user=ocid1.user.oc1..aaaaaaaak6z......
fingerprint=3b:7e:37:ec:a0:86:1....
key_file=~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem  
tenancy=ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaawpqblfem........
region=us-phoenix-1
```

##### GIT Settings File

If Git integration is required you will need to create a __git_repositories__ file within the directory 
__&lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.oci__ with contents similar to that below.

```properties
[OKIT Community]
branch = master
url = git@url1.git

[Internal]
branch = BRANCHNAME
url = git@url2.git
```

This properties file contains a list of the Git repositories you want to access. It assumes that you are using public/private
key access and the key files exist within your __&lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.ssh__ directory and the __&lt;USER HOME DIR&gt;/.ssh/config__
defines the key/url mapping.


#### Run Container

```bash
docker run -d --rm -p 80:80 --volume <USER HOME DIR>/okit/user/templates:/okit/templates --volume <USER HOME DIR>/.oci:/root/.oci --volume <USER HOME DIR>/.ssh:/root/.ssh --name okit okit
```

Once started the Designer BUI can be accessed on [http://localhost/okit/designer](http://localhost/okit/designer)
